<!-- Describe task in general -->
<p>
    Before solving this mission, you can try to solve the <a href="/mission/brackets/" target="_blank">"Brackets"</a> mission.
</p>
<p>
    Your task is to restore the balance of open and closed brackets by removing the unnecessary ones, while trying to use the minimum number of deletions.
</p>
<p>
    Only 3 types of brackets <b>"()", "[]", "{}"</b> can be used in the given string.
</p>
<p>
    Only a parenthesis can close a parenthesis. That is, in this expression <b class="code">"(}"</b> - the brackets aren’t balanced. In an empty string, i.e., in a string that doesn’t contain any brackets - the brackets are balanced, but removing all of the brackets isn’t considered to be an optimal solution.
</p>
<p>
    If there are more than one correct answer, then you should choose the one where the character that can be removed is closer to the beginning. For example, in this case <b class="code">"[(])"</b>,  the correct answer will be <b class="code">"()"</b>, since the removable brackets are closer to the beginning of the line.
