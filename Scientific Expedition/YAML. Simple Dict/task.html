<!-- Describe task in general -->
<p>
    Have you ever heard of such markup language as <a href="https://yaml.org/" target="_blank">YAML</a>?  It’s a friendly data serialization format. In fact it’s so friendly that both people and programs can read it quite well. You can play around with the standard by following <a href="https://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/" target="_blank">this link</a>.
</p>
<p>YAML is a text, and you need to convert it into an object. But I’m not asking you to implement the entire YAML standard, we’ll implement it step by step.</p>
<p>The first step is the key-value conversion. The key can be any string consisting of Latin letters and numbers. The value can be a single-line string (which consists of spaces, Latin letters and numbers) or a number (<b class="code">int</b>).</p>
<p>I’ll show some examples:</p>
<pre>
name: Alex
age: 12
</pre>
<p>Converted into a dictionary.</p>
<pre class="brush: python">
{ 
  "name": "Alex",
  "age": 12
} 
 </pre>
<p>Note that the number automatically gets type <b class="code">int</b>.</p>
<p>Another example shows that the string may contain spaces.<p>
<pre>
name: Alex Fox
age: 12

class: 12b
</pre>
<p>Will be converted into the next dictionary.</p>
<pre class="brush: python">
{
  "age": 12, 
  "name": "Alex Fox", 
  "class": "12b"
}
</pre>
<p>Pay attention to a few things. Between the string <b class="code">"age"</b> and the string <b class="code">"class"</b> there is an empty string that doesn’t interfere with parsing. The class starts with numbers, but has letters, which means it cannot be converted to numbers, so its type remains a <b class="code">str</b>.</p>
<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
<strong>Input:</strong> A format string. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Output:</strong> An object (dictionary). 
</p>
<!-- Give some usage examples -->
<div class="for_info_only">
<p>
<strong>Examples:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">assert yaml(&quot;name: Alex\nage: 12&quot;) == {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 12}
assert yaml(&quot;name: Alex Fox\nage: 12\n\nclass: 12b&quot;) == {
    &quot;age&quot;: 12,
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alex Fox&quot;,
    &quot;class&quot;: &quot;12b&quot;,
}
</pre>
</div>
<!-- Here you can explain some constraints for input-->
