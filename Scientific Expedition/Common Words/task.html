    Let's continue examining words. You are given two strings with words separated by commas.
    Try to find what is common between these strings. The words in the same string don't repeat.

</p>
<p>
    Your function should find all of the words that appear in both strings.
    The result must be represented as a string of words separated by commas in <strong>alphabetic order.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Input:</strong> Two arguments as strings <span translate="no">(str)</span>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Output:</strong> The common words as a string <span translate="no">(str)</span>.
</p>
<div class="for_info_only">
<p>
<strong>Examples:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">assert checkio(&quot;hello,world&quot;, &quot;hello,earth&quot;) == &quot;hello&quot;
assert checkio(&quot;one,two,three&quot;, &quot;four,five,six&quot;) == &quot;&quot;
assert checkio(&quot;one,two,three&quot;, &quot;four,five,one,two,six,three&quot;) == &quot;one,three,two&quot;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="for_info_only">
<strong>How it is used:</strong>
    Here you can learn how to work with strings and sets.
    This knowledge can be useful for linguistic analysis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Preconditions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each string contains no more than 10 words;</li>
<li>All words are separated by commas;</li>
<li>All words consist of lowercase latin letters.</li>
</ul>
