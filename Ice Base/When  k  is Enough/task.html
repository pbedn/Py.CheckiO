<!-- Describe task in general -->
<p>
    Given a list of items, some of which may be duplicated, create and return a new Iterable that is otherwise the same as <b class="code">items</b>, but only up to <b class="code">k</b> occurrences of each element are kept, and all occurrences of that element after those first <b class="code">k</b> are discarded. Note also the counterintuitive but still
    completely legitimate edge case of <b class="code">k == 0</b> that has a well defined answer of an empty list!
</p>
<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
<strong>Input:</strong> A list and an integer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Output:</strong> List or another Iterable (tuple, iterator, generator). 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Examples:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">assert list(remove_after_kth([42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42], 3)) == [42, 42, 42]
assert list(remove_after_kth([42, 42, 42, 99, 99, 17], 0)) == []
assert list(remove_after_kth([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], 5)) == [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]
</pre>
