<!-- Describe task in general -->
<p>
    Dr. Asimov, a robotics researcher, loves to research, but hates houseworks and his house were really dirty. So, he has developed a cleaning robot. 
</p>
<p>
    As shown in the following figure, his house has 9 rooms, where each room is identified by a letter of the alphabet:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="example" src="https://d17mnqrx9pmt3e.cloudfront.net/media/missions/media/92e4da1014a144aea855d35b3cb61ae9/cleaning-robot1.png" style="max-height: 300px" title="example"/>
</p>
<p>
    The robot operates as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>if the battery runs down, the robot stops;</li>
<li>if not so, the robot chooses a direction from four cardinal points with equal probability, and moves to the room in that direction. Then, the robot cleans the room and consumes 1 point of the battery;</li>
<li>However, if there is no room in that direction, the robot does not move and remains in the same room. In addition, there is a junk room in the house where the robot can not enter, and the robot also remains when it tries to enter the junk room. The robot also consumes 1 point of the battery when it remains in the same place.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    A battery charger for the robot is in a room. It would be convenient for Dr. Asimov if the robot stops at the battery room when its battery runs down. Your task is to write a program which computes the probability of the robot stopping at the battery room.
</p>
<p>
    You are given battery capacity <code>cap</code> and <code>start, bat, junk</code> respectively represent the room where the robot is initially, the battery room, and the junk room.
