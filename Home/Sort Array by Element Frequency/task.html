<!-- Describe task in general -->
<p>
    Sort the given list so that its
    elements should be grouped and those groups end up in the decreasing frequency order, that is, the number of
    times element appears in list. If two elements have the same frequency, their groups
    should end up in the same order as the first appearance of element in the list.
