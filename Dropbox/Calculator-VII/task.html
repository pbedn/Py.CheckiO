<i>The HP 12c financial calculator is still produced. It was introduced in 1981 and is still being made with few changes. The HP 12c featured the reverse Polish notation mode of data entry. In 2003 several new models were released, including an improved version of the HP 12c, the "HP 12c platinum edition" which added more memory, more built-in functions, and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator" target="_blank">Find more on wikipedia page...</a></i>

<p>
    In this series of missions you are going to build an elementary calculator.
</p>
<p>
    As an input, you get a sequence of keys pressed, and, as the result of that function, you should show what will be shown on the screen when the last key is pressed. Be attentive, it's not always the result of the expression. Actually, playing with the physical calculator or app will really helps you to catch edge cases.
</p>
<p>
    In the seventh mission the memory should be implemented with such operations: capital "A" (add, +), capital "S" (subtract, -), capital "G" (get value) and capital "E" (erase memory).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Expected behavior:</strong>
<ul>
<li><i>beginning zeros should be removed, only-zeros number - converted to single zero;</i></li>
<li><i>among +- signs between numbers, the last one should be taken;</i></li>
<li><i>"==" means repeating the last operation;</i></li>
<li><i>"+=" or "-=" - adding/subtracting the number (or operations result) before the combination (doubling the number/subtracting itself);</i></li>
<li><i>the calculator ignores digit you enter after 5th;</i></li>
<li><i>"-" for numbers &lt; 0 is NOT taking digit place;</i></li>
<li><i>if the abs(result) is more than 99999 - "error" is shown as a result;</i></li>
<li><i>for float, if the integer part of abs(result) is more then 9999 - "error" is shown as a result;</i></li>
<li><i>for float, in case the total length of number is more than 5 digits, it should be rounded to 5 digits (1.23456 -&gt; 1.235);</i></li>
<li><i>for float, beginning and trailing zeros should be removed (until the "." if possible): 0.1200 -&gt; .12 ,  123.00 -&gt; 123. . It should be done after the rounding: 1.000123 -&gt; 1. . Stripping of trailing zeros should only be done after entering a number has concluded (non-digit character pressed);</i></li>
<li><i>when after B's no signs remain and new digits are pressed - concatenate with the previous number: 12+B3 -&gt; 123 ;</i></li>
<li><i>"A"/"S" increase/decrease memory by previous number with cleaning the output;</i></li>
<li><i>"G" insert memory value if used after operation, clean output and insert value otherwise.</i></li>
</ul>
</p>
<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
<strong>Input:</strong> String.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Output:</strong> String.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Examples:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">assert calculator(&quot;100A90S&quot;) == &quot;0&quot;
assert calculator(&quot;100A90SG&quot;) == &quot;10&quot;
assert calculator(&quot;100A90EG&quot;) == &quot;0&quot;
assert calculator(&quot;ASG&quot;) == &quot;0&quot;
</pre>
<!-- Here you can explain how it can be used in development -->
<!-- The section is optional -->
<p class="for_info_only">
<strong>How itâ€™s used:</strong>
<i>Calculators are widely used. Understanding the principles of its input and output are interesting and useful.</i>
</p>
<!-- Here you can explain some constraints for input-->
<!-- The section is optional -->
<p>
<strong>Precondition:</strong>
<i>Allowed characters: digits (0-9), dot (.), signs +, -, =, *, /, //, %, ** and their combinations (+=, +-, ==, %= etc.), letters "B", "C", "A", "S", "G", "E". The integer number may contain no more than 5 digits, float - 4.</i>
