 Nicola discovered a caliper inside a set of drafting tools he received as a gift.
    Seeing the caliper, he has decided to learn how to use it.
</p>
<p>
 Through any three points that do not exist on the same line, there lies a unique circle.
    The points of this circle are represented in a string with the coordinates like so:
</p>
<pre>
    "(x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3)"

</pre>
<p>
 Where
 <em>
  x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3
 </em>
 are digits.
</p>
<p>
 You should find the circle for three given points, such
    that the circle lies through these point and return the result as a string
    with the equation of the circle.
    In a Cartesian coordinate system (with an X and Y axis),
    the circle with central coordinates of (x0,y0) and radius of r can be described with the following equation:
</p>
<pre>
    "(x-x0)^2+(y-y0)^2=r^2"

</pre>
<p>
 where
 <em>
  x0
 </em>
 ,
 <em>
  y0
 </em>
 ,
 <em>
  r
 </em>
 are decimal numbers rounded to
 <strong>
  two decimal points
 </strong>
 .
    Remove extraneous zeros and all decimal points, they are not necessary.
    For rounding, use the standard mathematical rules.

 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 Coordinates as a string..
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 The equation of the circle as a string.

  <strong>
   Example:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <pre class="brush: python">checkio("(2,2),(6,2),(2,6)") == "(x-4)^2+(y-4)^2=2.83^2"
checkio("(3,7),(6,9),(9,7)") == "(x-6)^2+(y-5.75)^2=3.25^2"</pre>
</div>
<p class="for_info_only">
 <strong>
  How it is used:
 </strong>
 This equation, also known as Equation of the Circle,
    comes from the Pythagorean theorem when applied to any point on a circle:
    the radius is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose other sides are of length x − a and y − b.
    Of course you can use this concept for you mathematics software, but we just want to remind about how awesome circles are.
