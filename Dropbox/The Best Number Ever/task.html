 It was Sheldon's version and his best number. But you have the coding skills to prove that there is
    a better number, or prove Sheldon sheldon right. You can return any number, but use the
    code to prove your number is the best!
</p>
<p>
 This mission is pretty simple to solve. You are given a function called "checkio" which will return any number (integer or float).
</p>
<p>
 Let's write an essay in python code which will explain why is your number is the best.
    Publishing the default solution will only earn you 0 points as the
    goal is to earn points through votes for your code essay.
