    This mission is dedicated to a famous and classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem" target="_blank">Knapsack Problem</a>. 
</p>
<p>
    You are given a list of kinds of items <b>items</b>, that you want to put into knapsack. Item of each kind is a tuple of its value, weight and maximum amount (optional). You need to find a subset of items, such that:
    <ul>
<li>the total value of the items in subset is as large as possible;</li>
<li>the total weight of items in subset is at most <b>weight</b>, that is capacity of the knapsack;</li>
<li>for each kind of items you can select at most given amount items. If its not given - there is no restriction for amount.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
<strong>Input:</strong> Two arguments. Maximum weight as integer, items as list of tuples of two or three integers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Output:</strong> Maximum value as integer. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Examples:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">assert knapsack(5, [(4, 2, 1), (5, 2, 1), (2, 1, 1), (8, 3, 1)]) == 13
assert knapsack(8, [(4, 2), (5, 2), (2, 1), (8, 3)]) == 21
assert knapsack(8, [(10, 10, 3)]) == 0
assert knapsack(8, [(4, 3, 2), (2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 4), (3, 2, 2)]) == 12
</pre>
<!-- Here you can explain how it can be used in development -->
<!-- The section is optional -->
<!-- <p class="for_info_only">

    <strong>How itâ€™s used:</strong>
    <i>(math is used everywhere)</i>
</p> -->
<!-- Here you can explain some constraints for input-->
<!-- The section is optional -->
<!-- <p>
    <strong>Preconditions:</strong>
    <ul>
    <li><i>both given ints should be between -1000 and 1000</i></li>
    </ul>
