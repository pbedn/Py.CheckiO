    In computer science and discrete mathematics,
    an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_(discrete_mathematics)">inversion</a>
    is a pair of places in a sequence where the elements in these places are out of their natural order. So, if we use
    ascending order for a group of numbers, then an inversion is when larger numbers appear before lower number in a
    sequence.
</p>
<p>
    Check out this example sequence: (1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 7, 6) and we can see here three inversions<br/>
    - 5 and 3;<br/>
    - 5 and 4;<br/>
    - 7 and 6.<br/>
</p>
<p>
    You are given a sequence of unique numbers and you should count the number of inversions in this sequence.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Input: </strong> A sequence as a tuple of integers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Output: </strong> The inversion number as an integer.

<strong>Example:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">
count_inversion((1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 7, 6)) == 3
count_inversion((0, 1, 2, 3)) == 0
</pre>

<strong>How it is used: </strong>
    In this mission you will get to experience the wonder of nested loops,
    that is of course, if you don't use advanced algorithms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Precondition:</strong>
    2 &lt; len(sequence) &lt; 200<br/>
    len(sequence) == len(set(sequence))<br/>
    all(-100 &lt; x &lt; 100 for x in sequence)
