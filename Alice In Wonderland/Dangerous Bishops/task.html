    The generalized square chessboard has been taken over by an army of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_(chess)" target="_blank">bishops</a>, each bishop represented as a two-tuple <code>(row, col)</code> (0-base indexing) of the coordinates of the square that the bishop stands on. Given the board size <code>n</code> and the list of bishops on that board, count the number of safe squares that are not covered by any bishop.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Let's look at the case <code>4, [(2, 3), (0, 1)]</code>, which is <code>11</code>.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>
        To check whether two squares (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) are reachable from each other in a single bishop move, the expression abs(r1-r2)==abs(c1-c2) checks that the horizontal distance between those squares equals their vertical distance, which is both necessary and sufficient for those squares  to lie on  the same diagonal. This way you don’t have  to separately rewrite  the essentially identical block of logic four times, but one test handles all four diagonal directions in one swoop.
