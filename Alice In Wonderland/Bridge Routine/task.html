<p style="text-align: justify;">
    The trick taking power of a bridge hand is estimated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_evaluation" target="_blank">Milton Work point count</a>, of which we shall implement a version that is simple enough for beginners of either <b>Python</b> or the game of <b>bridge</b>!  
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Looking at a bridge hand that consists of thirteen cards as tuples <span translate="no"><code>(rank, suit)</code></span>:
</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">give it 4 points for each <span translate="no">ace</span>, 3 points for each <span translate="no">king</span>, 2 points for each <span translate="no">queen</span>, and 1 point for each <span translate="no">jack</span>. This <strong>raw point count</strong> is then adjusted with the following rules.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">if the hand contains one 4-cards suit and three 3-cards suits, subtract one point for being <b>flat</b>. (<i>Flat hands rarely play as well as non-flat hands of equal point count.</i>)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">add 1 point for every suit that has 5 cards, 2 points for every suit that has 6 cards, and 3 points for every suit with 7 cards or longer. (<i>Shape is power for the declarer.</i>)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">if the <code>trump</code> is anything other than <code>"notrump"</code>, add 5 points for every <b>void</b> (that is, suit without any cards in it) and 3 points for every <b>singleton</b> (that is, a suit with exactly one card), both of these for any other suit than the <code>trump</code> suit. (<i>Voids and singletons are great when you are playing a suit contract, but very bad in a notrump contract. Being void or a singleton in the trump suit is, of course, extremely bad!</i>)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Hands are often given in abbreviated form that makes their relevant aspects easier to visualize at a glance. In this abbreviated shorthand form, suits are always listed in the exact order of <b>spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs</b>, so no special symbols are needed to show which suit is which. The ranks in each suit are listed as letters  from <code>"AKQJ"</code> for <b>aces, faces</b> and all <b>spot</b> cards lower than <span translate="no">jack</span> are written out as the same letter <code>"x"</code> to indicate that its exact spot value is irrelevant for the play mechanics of that hand. These letters must be listed in descending order of ranks AKQJx. If some suit is <b>void</b>, that is, the hand contains no cards of that suit, that suit is abbreviated with a minus sign character "-". The shorthand forms for the individual suits are separated using single spaces, with no trailing whitespace. 
</p>
<p>
    Your function must return a number of points and a shorthand form of a given hand.
