</p>
<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
<strong>Input:</strong> Heights of the buildings as a 2D-list. Building height is defined as a column in a list.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Output:</strong> The number of the highest building and height of it as a list of integers (Important: in this task the building numbers starts from "1", not from "0"). 
</p>
<!-- Put some usage examples -->
<div class="for_info_only">
<p>
<strong>Examples:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">assert highest_building([[0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1]]) == [

<!-- Here you can explain how it can be used in development and what is usage of this. -->
<!-- The section is optional -->
<p class="for_info_only">
<strong>How it is used:</strong>
<i>
        Every true programmer should know how to work with the 2D-lists.
    </i>
</p>
<!-- Here you can explain some constraints for input-->
<!-- The section is optional -->
<p><strong>Preconditions:</strong>
<ul>
<li><i>array width &lt;= 10;</i></li>
<li><i>array height &lt;= 10;</i></li>
<li><i>there is only 1 highest building in each array.</i></li>
</ul>
