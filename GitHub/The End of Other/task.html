 For language training our Robots want to learn about suffixes.
</p>
<p>
 In this task, you are given a set of words in lower case.
    Check whether there is a pair of words, such that one word is the end of another (a suffix of another).
    For example: {"hi", "hello", "lo"} -- "lo" is the end of "hello", so the result is True.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 Words as a set of strings.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 True or False, as a boolean.
</p>
<div class="for_info_only">

  <strong>
   Example:
  </strong>
 </p>
 
 <pre class="brush: python">checkio({"hello", "lo", "he"}) == True
checkio({"hello", "la", "hellow", "cow"}) == False
checkio({"walk", "duckwalk"}) == True
checkio({"one"}) == False
checkio({"helicopter", "li", "he"}) == False
</pre>

 <strong>
  How it is used:
 </strong>
 Here you can learn about iterating through set type and string data type functions.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Precondition:
 </strong>
 2 â‰¤ len(words) &lt; 30
 <br/>
 all(re.match(r"\A[a-z]{1,99}\Z", w) for w in words)
