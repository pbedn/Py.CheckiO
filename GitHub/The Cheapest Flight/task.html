<p><i>"We need to fly home as cheaply as possible so that more money is left for gifts. Aunt Lidia asked for different kinds of cheeses, and Vasia wanted a new toy car. I’ve been looking at the schedule for quite a while and I’m starting to think that some planes are flying in vain".</i></p>
<p>As the input you get the flight schedule as list, each element of which is the price of a direct flight between 2 cities (list of 3 elements - 2 city names as a string, and a flight price).</p>
<p>Planes fly in both directions and the price in both directions is the same. There is a possibility that there are no direct flights between cities.</p>
<p>Find the price of the cheapest flight between cities that are given as the 2nd and 3rd arguments. In case the flight can not be performed, return 0.</p>
<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
<strong>Input:</strong> 3 arguments: the flight schedule as a list of lists, city of departure and destination city as strings.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>Output:</strong> The best price as integer.
